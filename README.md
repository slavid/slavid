# About me
Graduated in IT in the University of Cantabria, Spain (2010 - 2016), I have since then worked for some of the most important companies in Spain (Santander Bank, Telefonica, etcâ€¦) and some Consulting companies as a System Administrator with some DevOps.

I will try to upload some projects to my GitHub account and to my blog which I will try to update from time to time whenever there is something relevant to write about.
